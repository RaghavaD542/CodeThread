<strong>**#CodeThread**</strong>\
**CodeThread** is a **Synchronized collaborative** coding platform built with **MERN** stack that allows multiple users to connect and work together on coding projects. It utilizes web sockets for seamless communication between users.

**Features**\
CodeThread enables **multiple users** to simultaneously write code in real-time. As you make changes to the code, other users in the same room will see those changes instantly. This makes it easy to collaborate, review code, and brainstorm ideas together.

You can create your own room or join an existing one. The room-based system allows you to code with your friends on specific projects simultaneously.

Once you join a room, You are redirected to the editor page. The editor page provides a shared workspace where multiple users can edit code simultaneously.

**Python Code Execution**\
CodeThread offers a convenient Python run button within the editor page. If the code you've written is in Python, you can execute it directly in the browser. Additionally, you have the option to provide input for your code to see the output.
